This is the backend (server side) of my thesis project.
The website is called myMed, and the final version of the backend was uploaded on Heroku (Where the ENV variables are stored).

The initial objective of this thesis is to develop a web application for doctors capable of
managing patients’ data. The management of patients’ data involves recording and processing
their health record, physical examination, diagnosis, and therapy.

The technologies mainly used for this project are Node.js, Express.js, mongoose and Algolia.
